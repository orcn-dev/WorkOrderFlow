# WorkOrderFlow

WorkOrderFlow is an ASP.NET Core MVC operations management application designed for small businesses and service teams that need to manage customers, quotes, work orders, inventory, material usage, dashboard metrics, and PDF exports from a single workflow.

The project focuses on a real business process:

```text
Customer → Quote → Work Order → Materials Used → Inventory Update → PDF Output → Dashboard
```

---

## Overview

WorkOrderFlow is built as a portfolio-grade business application. It demonstrates how a real-world operations system can track customers, create quotes, convert operational work into work orders, consume inventory items through material usage records, and generate PDF documents for both quotes and work orders.

The main goal of the project is not only to provide CRUD screens, but to model an actual business workflow with domain logic.

## Tech Stack

* ASP.NET Core MVC
* C#
* Entity Framework Core
* SQLite
* Razor Views
* Bootstrap
* QuestPDF
* Git / GitHub

## Domain Workflow

The core workflow of the application is:

```text
1. A customer is created.
2. A quote is prepared for the customer.
3. The quote can be exported as a PDF.
4. A work order is created from the customer and optional quote.
5. Materials used in the work order are recorded.
6. Inventory stock is automatically reduced.
7. Work order details show the used materials and material totals.
8. The work order can be exported as a PDF.
9. Dashboard metrics reflect operational activity.
```

This workflow demonstrates customer management, quoting, job tracking, stock movement, reporting, and document generation.

## Main Entities

### Customer

Represents a person or business that receives quotes and work orders.

### Quote

Represents a price offer connected to a customer. It includes labor cost, parts cost, discount, total amount, status, and validity date.

### WorkOrder

Represents the actual operational job. It includes status, priority, due date, completion date, and resolution notes.

### InventoryItem

Represents a stock item that can be used in work orders. It tracks available quantity, reorder level, cost, and sale price.

### WorkOrderMaterial

Represents a material used in a work order. It connects work orders to inventory items and updates inventory quantity through business logic.

---

## Business Logic

The most important domain rule in the project is inventory stock movement.

When a material is added to a work order:

```text
InventoryItem.QuantityOnHand -= WorkOrderMaterial.QuantityUsed
```

When a material usage record is deleted:

```text
InventoryItem.QuantityOnHand += WorkOrderMaterial.QuantityUsed
```

This moves the project beyond basic CRUD and demonstrates real operational behavior.

---

## PDF Generation

PDF export is implemented with QuestPDF.

The application currently supports:

* Quote PDF export
* Work Order PDF export

PDF files include customer information, quote or work order details, pricing data, material usage, and generated timestamps.
